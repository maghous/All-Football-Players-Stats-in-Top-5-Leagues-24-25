## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides comprehensive statistical analysis of player performance across Europe's top 5 football leagues: **Premier League**, **La Liga**, **Serie A**, **Bundesliga**, and **Ligue 1**. Using advanced data analytics and visualization techniques, we explore player metrics, team comparisons, and performance trends.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-League Analysis**: Comprehensive comparison across all Big 5 European leagues
- **Player Performance Metrics**: Goals, assists, pass accuracy, defensive actions, and more
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs for better data interpretation
- **Statistical Insights**: Advanced metrics including xG, xA, and efficiency ratings
- **Team Comparisons**: Squad-level analysis and comparisons
- **Trend Analysis**: Performance evolution over time

## 📈 Analytics Covered

### Offensive Metrics
- Goals and Goal Conversion Rate
- Expected Goals (xG) and xG per 90 minutes
- Assists and Expected Assists (xA)
- Shot Accuracy and Shot Creation
- Key Passes and Through Balls

### Defensive Metrics
- Tackles Won and Interceptions
- Clearances and Blocks
- Aerial Duels Won
- Clean Sheets (Goalkeepers)
- Defensive Actions per 90 minutes

### Possession & Passing
- Pass Completion Rate
- Progressive Passes
- Dribbles Completed
- Ball Recovery
- Possession Lost/Won

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Development environment
